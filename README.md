# Approximate solutions to differential equations using the [Euler method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method)

Just a little Python program that computes and plots arbitrarily accurate solutions to differential equations of the form dy/dx = f(y) (autonomous or time-invariant systems).

I might expand this in the future to include the option of additional Runge-Kutta methods...
